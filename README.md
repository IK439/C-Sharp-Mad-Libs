# Mad Libs Game (C#)

This is a simple **Mad Libs** game written in C#. The program prompts the user to input various types of words (like nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.), and then creates a funny story by inserting the user's inputs into a predefined template. Finally, it displays the generated story.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user for a series of inputs, such as:
   - A name
   - Adjectives
   - Nouns
   - A verb
   - And more!
   
2. The program then inserts those inputs into a story template and generates a fun and unique story based on the user’s choices.

3. The story is printed in the console after the user has completed all the prompts.

**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `Program.cs`.
2. In a terminal, create a console project if needed:

   ```bash
   dotnet new console -o MadLibs
   cd MadLibsApp
   ```
3. Replace the generated `Program.cs` with your code.
4. Run:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
